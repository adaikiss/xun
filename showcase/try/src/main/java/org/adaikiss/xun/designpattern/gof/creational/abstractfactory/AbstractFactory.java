/**
 * <b>Abstract Factory</b>
 * <pre>
 * Definition
 *   Provides one level of interface higher than the {@link Factory} pattern. 
 *   It is used to return one of several factories.
 * Where to use & benefits
 *   Creates families of related or dependent objects like Kit.
 *   Provides a class library of products, exposing interface not implementation.
 *   Needs to isolate concrete classes from their super classes.
 *   A system needs independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
 *   Try to enforce a constraint.
 *   An alternative to {@link Facade} to hide platform-specific classes
 *   Easily extensible to a system or a family
 *   Related patterns include
 *     {@link Factory} method, which is often implemented with an abstract factory.
 *     {@link Singleton}, which is often implemented with an abstract factory.
 *     {@link Prototype}, which is often implemented with an abstract factory.
 *     {@link Façade}, which is often used with an abstract factory by providing an interface for creating implementing class.
